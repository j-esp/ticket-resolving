<h1>Ticket Resolving</h1>
In this activity, I will demonstrate the ticket lifecycle—from intake to resolution—using the open-source help desk ticketing system, osTicket.

<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<p>
To create tickets, end-users must access the ticket portal and submit a request detailing their IT-related issues. In this simulation, I created tickets addressing various potential problems encountered in a real environment. Help Topics provide an overview of the issue, while the ticket details capture the specifics of the end-user's concerns.

<p>
From an admin's perspective, tickets are listed under "Open Tickets," where they can be resolved or reassigned to an appropriate individual or team. Issues are prioritized by severity and addressed according to the Service Level Agreement (SLA) timelines. In this instance, Jane assessed the ticket, reallocated it to the System Administrators, marked it as Emergency severity, and ensured ongoing communication with the client. This approach supports effective client management and adherence to business standards.

<p>
Effective and clear communication is crucial when resolving tickets. Coordination with both the team and the affected user is necessary. Tickets, which vary in nature and may require reassignment, should be carefully documented. This documentation serves as a valuable reference for addressing similar issues in the future.

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
Ticket management protocols can vary by business. Some organizations may set quotas for the number of tickets to be resolved within a specific timeframe, and prioritize tickets based on their urgency. This activity has enhanced my understanding of how a ticketing system is applied in IT.
